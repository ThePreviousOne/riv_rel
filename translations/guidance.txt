translating .py files:
	
	these are all code, but you can open them in Notepad++

   the things that you want to replace are between ''
       if you see something like x = 'some text here '\
                                     'then more text here'
       then x will show up as 'some text here then more text here'
	   
   if you have an apostrophe ('), you need to write it as \'
   
   variables (names, numbers, relations) will be inserted into sentences between {}
       the variable name is here, e.g. '{x_firstname} is {y_firstname}\'s parent'
	   
   any line starting with # is a comment, so it won't affect the code itself
   
   some of these need a space at the start and/or end (if so, there'll be a comment next to it)
   some of these need a line break - shown by \n - at the start and/or end (will also be in comments)
   
   things you don't need to translate
       command names (basically anything starting with "riv_")
       file names
       anything between {}

   if you're translating something that is gendered, put it in a tuple with (male ver, female ver)
   an example with one sim:
       cousin = 'cousin'               # EN
       cousin = ('primo', 'prima')     # ES

   there is also this shortcut to use 'o' if male and 'a' if female:
       cousin = 'prim@'

   more gendering
   an example with multiple sims, where only one sim's gender matters (please make a note of which in the comments)
       get_parents_1 = '{y_firstname} {y_lastname} is {x_firstname}\'s parent'
       get_parents_1 = ('{y_firstname} {y_lastname} es el padre de {x_firstname}', '{y_firstname} {y_lastname} es la madre de {x_firstname}')     # use gender: sim_y
   an example with multiple sims
       get_sib_strength_1 = '{x_firstname} and {y_firstname} are full siblings.'
       get_sib_strength_1 = '{x_firstname} y {y_firstname} son herman@s complet@s' # first version is used if one is male, and the second if both female

   please let me know if
       something doesn't quite work in your language
           e.g. "step-parent" is a completely different word and not just "step" + "parent"
       you need more context
       there are more than two gendered versions
           it depends on both sims' genders separately
           your language has three+ grammatical genders
		   
	very high priority:

		5_relations (this will be the hardest part of the work, as it contains the actual words for relations)
